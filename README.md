# Covid 19 Vaccination Booking - Salesforce


[Book Your Slot](https://binge-developer-edition.ap24.force.com/covidsupport)

# FEATURES:
You can look for a vaccination slot based on district and postal code.
The data is evidently visible because of the colours.
The interface lets you filter results based on center name, vaccine type, available slots, and minimum age.
If a slot is available, it navigates you to the government’s CoWin website to book a slot for yourself. (Reason mentioned below)

# FEATURES – FUTURE SCOPE:
So instead of heading to CoWIN website and booking a slot, I am working on leveraging this functionality in Salesforce where one can authorise themselves with a phone number. But this is something that will not be available soon.

Now that you’ve created a Salesforce DX project, what’s next? Here are some documentation resources to get you started.

## This site only works for bookings in India.
